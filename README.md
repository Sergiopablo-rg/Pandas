# Pandas

This is a summary (notes and examples) of "Learning the Pandas Library" written by Matt Harrison. 

Pandas is a data analysis library for python. It contains high level data structures and manipulation tools designed to make data analysis fast and easy in Python. 

One of the trends that I have seen in that time is the uptake of Python for various aspects of "data science"- gathering data, cleaning data, analysis, machine learning, and visualization. The pandas library has seen much uptake in this area.

Pandas is built on top of NumPy and makes it easy to use in NumPy-centric applications.
